## About billing stuff
All prices and money related stuff stored in cents (Â¢), not in dollars.
In most places, we provide convenient property for amount in dollars.
For example, if we have field `price` in model `Foo`, than we have a property 
called `dollar_price`.


## About initial data
Why we use native objects instead of storing them as JSON (fixtures)?

Because fixtures have some problems:
- They don't give a guarantee that relations such as ForeignKey, OneToOne, ManyToMany
will be resolved correctly. Relations by default represented as integers (PK) and 
at records creation time, `loaddata` doesn't guarantee a correct order of model creation.
Preferable, to use `--natural-foreign` and `--natural-primary` with `dumpdata` command.
But it require of implementation `get_by_natural_key` and `natural_key` method on models and managers.

    - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/django-admin/#dumpdata
    - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/serialization/#topics-serialization-natural-keys
- Fixture doesn't provide a guarantee between ports of databases. As example, we can't load data
from PostgreSQL into SQLite and vice versa.
